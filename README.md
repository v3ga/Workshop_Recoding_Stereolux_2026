# Recoding : aux sources du dessin génératif / Stereolux / 2026
This workshop will revisit the seminal works of the pioneers of generative art from the 1960s and 1970s: Colette and Charles Bangart, Manfred Mohr, Frieder Nake, Georg Nees, Michael Noll, Vera Molnár, and others. At a time when computers and plotters were confined to research laboratories, these artists paved the way for new forms of creation using algorithmic material.<br />
